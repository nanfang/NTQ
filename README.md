# Project spruce
A task queue and workflow system. The idea is inspired by my last 5 years of working of managing millions of backend jobs a day that run in a distributed network.

# Tenets
- Each task's information is persisted and trackable.
- Each task can be executed by any language which hooks the task.
- Task sender and worker can run from different networks.


# Language support
- From Python 3.x
- Plan to support Java, C# and Ruby
