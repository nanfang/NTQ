# Project Spruce (first version of TaskBay)
A task queue and workflow system. The idea is inspired by my last 5 years of work of managing millions of backend jobs a day that run in a distributed network.


# Tenets
- Each task's information is persistent and trackable.
- Each task is scheduled. Realtime task is scheduled at NOW.
- Each task can be executed by any language which hooks the task.
- Task sender and worker can run from different networks.
- Event driven workflow.
- Python 3 only.


# Language support
- From Python 3.x
- Plan to support Java, C# and Ruby
